<h1 align="center">Android Audiomack StreamBot</h1>


## Project Overview:

This project is a stealth mobile automation bot for Audiomack, designed to simulate high-volume, undetectable song plays on Android devices. Unlike traditional bots that rely on unstable API hacking or outdated desktop methods, this solution leverages real device emulation via Appium to bypass Audiomack’s anti-bot detection entirely. No login or account generation is needed, as Audiomack plays are public—making this a streamlined approach for artists or promoters aiming to boost song visibility, engagement metrics, and algorithmic favor.
